# 🛡️ Prompt Health Checker

**Prompt Health Checker** is an intelligent LLM safety tool that evaluates user-entered prompts for **privacy**, **bias**, **toxicity**, and **prompt injection** risks. It generates safe alternatives using Cohere and flags risky language using smart rule-based and contextual detection.

> ⚡ Built for AI developers, enterprise compliance teams, researchers, and safety-first LLM startups.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Multi-Risk Detection**  
  Identifies PII exposure, gender bias, prompt injection, and offensive content.

- ✨ **Safe Prompt Rewriter**  
  Rewrites unsafe prompts using [Cohere API](https://cohere.ai).

- 🧠 **Smart Rule Matching**  
  Context-aware detection (e.g., “brutal attack” vs “brutal workout”).

- 📊 **Risk Levels**  
  Flags prompts as `Low`, `Medium`, or `High` risk with explanations.

- 🧪 **Developer Mode**  
  Shows matched rules and explanations (toggleable via sidebar).

- 📁 **Batch Analyzer**  
  Upload CSV, PDF, or PNG files and auto-analyze all prompts.

- 📥 **Report Export**  
  Download result summaries in CSV format.

- 🖥️ **Streamlit UI**  
  Clean, interactive UI for tech and non-tech users.
